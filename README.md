# Biomedical Imaging in Java

This is Fiji's fork of Michael Abramoff's "Biomedical Imaging in Java" (bij)
ImageJ 1.x plugins. The original project website is here:

    http://bij.isi.uu.nl/

This component contains the FlowJ, VolumeJ, SurfaceJ and Volume Reconstructor
plugins only. For the library code upon which they are built, see:

## Licensing

The original license for bij (as seen in source headers) was not open source:

> of it and its documentation or any parts of it ("the software"), for any purpose is

Fortunately, the author granted permission for the code to be relicensed as GPLv3:

> Hi Michael,
>
> I'm writing to ask if you would be willing to relicense your old "Biomedical
> Imaging in Java" (BIJ) project under a GPL-compatible open-source license --
> either a permissive one such as BSD-2, or a copyleft one such as GPLv3.
>
> We have distributed BIJ code with the Fiji project for many years (see
    > https://github.com/fiji/FlowJ and https://github.com/fiji/bij), but I do
> not know whether you ever gave permission for us to do this.
>
> Therefore, I'm seeking your blessing now. If you are willing to allow the
> relicensing, we can keep distributing FlowJ et al. with Fiji. Otherwise, for
> legal reasons we would need to remove BIJ from the distribution.
>
> How should we proceed?
